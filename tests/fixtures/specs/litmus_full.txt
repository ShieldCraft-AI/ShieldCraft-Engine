THE LITMUS ENGINE

5.3 Enforced Restraint

The system must enforce restraint: Severity-gated output.
Every run must provide a canonical decision artifact and a SHA-256 hash.

6. Trust Contract

Every major conclusion must include at least one of:
- Why the conclusion is reliable
- Why it is explicitly bounded
- Why a less disciplined tool would mislead here

10.1 Visible Uncertainty

Uncertainty must be: Localized

10.2 Mandatory Refusal Conditions

The system must refuse when critical paths lack tests or contracts.
