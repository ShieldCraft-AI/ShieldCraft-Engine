Resolve circular dependency in checklist.

Cycle detected: {{ cycle_items | join(" -> ") }}
Length: {{ cycle_length }}

Cycle resolution guidance (deterministic placeholder):
1. Identifying the weakest dependency link
2. Reordering tasks to eliminate circular reference
3. Introducing intermediate task to break the chain
4. Updating spec to remove circular constraint
