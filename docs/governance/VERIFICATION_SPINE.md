# Verification Spine (v1)

The Verification Spine is a first-class governance subsystem of ShieldCraft Engine.

Its role is to validate SE outputs against structural, semantic, and epistemic guarantees.

This document defines the existence and scope of the spine only. Verification properties and enforcement logic are defined elsewhere.
