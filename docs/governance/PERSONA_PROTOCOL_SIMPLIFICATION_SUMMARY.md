# Persona Protocol Simplification Summary (Phase 7)

This short summary quantifies the consolidation achieved by Phase 7 (documentation-only).

Counts (docs/persona directory)
- Documents (before): 7 (core + supporting + historical + legacy backups)
- Documents (after): 7 (no deletions; reclassified and consolidated references)

Word counts (selected):
- `docs/persona/PERSONA_PROTOCOL.md` — before: 708 words; after: 318 words (condensed canonical core)
- `docs/persona/legacy/*` — preserved historical content (total: ~1,866 words)
- Net effect: core protocol condensed (~390 word reduction in canonical doc)

Decision rule counts (qualitative):
- Decision rules in canonical protocol before: multiple sections across several docs
- Decision rules after: consolidated into a single minimal core (authority classes, routing model, precedence, event rules).

Simplification table (short):

| Metric | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| Persona docs | 7 | 7 |
| Canonical doc words | 708 | 318 |
| Legacy docs preserved (words) | 1,866 | 1,866 |

Summary: Phase 7 reduced the canonical surface area and concentrated normative rules into `PERSONA_PROTOCOL.md`, while preserving historical and supporting materials as references. This consolidation reduces the cognitive surface for reviewers and implementers while preserving all audit traces.
